# OneClick Calendar

I have a habit of scheduling everyday. However, adding the same events that I had added before can be annoying. So I coded it to make my repeated task easier.

This is a Chrome extension works with Google Calendar. A tool shows up when **adding** and **modifying event**.

You can create or modify an event with a ***single click***.

E.g. Add event

## Quick start
1. Download the project on you computer `git clone https://github.com/junweinotavailable/oneclick-calendar`
2. Go to Chrome extension (chrome://extensions/) and turn on the developer mode
3. Upload the downloaded folder
