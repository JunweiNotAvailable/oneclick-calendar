# OneClick Calendar

I have a habit of scheduling everyday. However, adding the same events that I had added before can be annoying. So I coded it to make my repeated task easier.

This is a Chrome extension works with Google Calendar. A tool shows up when **adding** and **modifying event**.

You can create or modify an event with a ***single click***.

1. Add event

2. Add text to title

3. Add description to existing event
